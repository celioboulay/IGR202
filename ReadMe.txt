Implemented the Predictive-Corrective Incompressible SPH (PCISPH) algorithm in C++, based on Solenthaler & Pajarola (2009). The method improves the efficiency of particle-based fluid simulations by iteratively correcting density errors without solving a global Poisson system, enabling large time steps and significant performance gains.

Replace the src folder in the SPH TP by this one, and then compile the code as usual
